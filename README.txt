The secret of the bwaq bwaq
Or the bak bak or the bak baq or the bq bq, not sure how to spell it in English, if you’re curious what it’s supposed to be Il explain at the end.
The secret of the bq bq is a story dad uses to tell me as a child, I’m not sure its exact origins, he is Syrian and it’s apparently a silly 4th grade story. I want to archive it somewhere and this is the best I could do.
The story is translated from what I remember so it’s not exact.
The best time to tell this story is when someone specifically asks you to tell them a story.
The story starts with a guy getting robbed, the guy swears he has nothing on him but the robber threatens him anyways, so he tells the robber if he knows about the secret of the bq bq, the robber says no, so the man tell him: “in my house there is a map that leads to the secret of the bq bq” the robber asks where the guy’s house is and the guy tells him:”to reach my house you have go to straight ahead until you find not the first street, not the second street, not the third street, not the fourth street, not the fifth street, not the sixth street, not the seventh street, but the eight street. And then when you go there turn right and go to not the first building, or the second building or the third building or the fourth building or the fifth building but the 6th building. Inside that building you go to not the first floor or second floor or third floor or fourth floor or fifth floor or sixth floor or seventh floor or the eight floor but the ninth floor, and in the right you go to not the first or the second or the third or the fourth but the fifth apartment, inside the apartment you don’t go to the first room or the second or the third or the fourth but the fifth room, there is a cabinet to the right, you don’t go to the first second or third drawer inside there is a key for a safe with a map to the secret of the bq bq. The robber follows the instructions and finds the map. The map says “if you want to find the secret of the bq bq you need to go right from where you found this map to not the first dock or the second dock or the third dock but the fourth.”. I think you get the point of the story now, you just make up infinite things for the robber to do and its entire point is to string along and waste the listeners time with the “secret of the bq bq”.
The story usually ends in when the robber finds a chest underwater and open it, the chest releases bubbles and makes the bq bq sound of bubbles escaping.
